                                        **Data types in Javascript**

Javascript has a set of rules in declaring the variables based on the value the variable is about to hold,
Which is defined as Data Types. Based on the defined terms, JS has 2 classifications in Data Types
they are 
    =>Primitive Data Types
    =>Non-Primitive Data Types

Primitive Data Types:
    These are the built-in  data types that are provided by Javascript,They represent single values and are not mutable.
    The given below are the members of Primitive Data Types
        =>Number
            This is the data type in JavaScript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.
            eg : let num = 100; (or) let num = 100.1;
        =>String
            This data type in JavaScript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by single or double quotes.
            eg: let str = 'Sundar'; (or) let str = "Sundar";
        =>Undefined
            This means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, or it has been explicitly set to the value `undefined`.
            eg: let und;
        =>Boolean
            This data types only holds either "True" or "False" as values.
            eg: let bool = true;
        =>Null
            This data type consists an empty space in the storage defined by "null"(Case Sensitive) keyword.
            eg: let n = null;
        =>BigInt
            This data type allows a wide spectrum of numbers to be stored, I.E numbers greater than (2^53)-1.
            The number is specified by writing 'n' at the end of the value.
            eg : let big = 192938475648390182756375637215647890873n
        =>Symbol
            This data type used to create objects which will always be unique. these objects can be created using Symbol constructor.
            eg : let sym = Symbol("Hi");

Non-Primitive Data Types:
    Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are objects and derived data types.
    They can store collections of values or more complex entities. The non-primitive data types in JavaScript are:
        =>Objects
            These are entities having properties and methods, They are created to be a representative to call the data with reference.
            eg :
            let car = {
                brand : "Nissan",
                model : "GT",
                price : 25000000
            };
            let obj = new car();
            console.log(obj.brand);
        =>Arrays
            They are A specialized type of object used to store ordered collections of values.
            Array elements are accessed by their numerical index.
            eg:
            let car = ['Nissan','Ford','Tata'];
            console.log(car);
            console.log(car[1]);
        =>Functions:
            They are Blocks of reusable code designed to perform specific tasks.
            In JavaScript, functions are also considered objects and can be assigned to variables,
            passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
            eg:
            let a = 100;
            let b = 200;
            function add(){
                console.log(a+b);
            }
